AUTOMATIC NODETITLE
====================

This is a lightweight module that allows the node title to be generated
automatically. The node title field can be hidden on the node form, or automatic
generation can be set occur only when the title field is left empty.

Tokens can be used as replacement patterns in the auto-generated title. For
example, the token [current-user:name] would be replaced with the currently
logged in user's name.
